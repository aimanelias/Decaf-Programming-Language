# Decaf Compiler Project

## Overview
This project implements a recursive descent parser and compiler for a subset of the Decaf programming language. It includes a lexer, parser, and supporting infrastructure for compiling and analyzing Decaf source code. The project is structured for use with BlueJ and can be run from the command line.

## Project Structure

- **Decaf.java**: Main compiler implementation (recursive descent parser, symbol table, code generation).
- **Tok.java**: Token management and classification for the parser.
- **MutableInt.java**: Utility class for mutable integer values (used for attributed grammars).
- **decaf/**: Contains generated and supporting code for lexer, parser, AST nodes, and analysis.
  - **lexer/**: Lexer implementation (generated by SableCC).
  - **node/**: Token and AST node classes (generated by SableCC).
  - **analysis/**: Analysis interfaces and adapters (generated by SableCC).
  - **parser/**: (Empty or generated parser code, if present).
- **Sample Input Files**:
  - `german.decaf`: Decaf source code in German-like syntax.
  - `NewComp.decaf`: Decaf source code in English syntax.
  - `NewComp(ALL).txt`: Both English and German versions of a sample program.
  - `LabWeek13.decaf`, `cos.decaf`: Additional sample programs.
- **MANUAL.txt**: Quick start and usage instructions.
- **README.TXT**: Template for project documentation (superseded by this README.md).

## How to Build and Run

### Requirements
- Java (JDK)
- [BlueJ](https://www.bluej.org/) (optional, for visual development)

### Steps
1. **Compile the Project**
   - Open the project in BlueJ and compile all classes, **or**
   - Use the command line:
     ```sh
     javac *.java
     ```
2. **Run the Compiler**
   - Open a command prompt in the project directory (use `open_MSPrompt.bat` if needed).
   - Run the compiler with a Decaf source file as input:
     ```sh
     java Decaf < german.decaf
     ```
   - Replace `german.decaf` with any other sample input file as desired.

## File Descriptions

- **Decaf.java**: Implements the main compiler logic, including parsing, symbol table management, and code generation for Decaf programs.
- **Tok.java**: Handles tokenization and classification of input for the parser.
- **MutableInt.java**: Helper class for mutable integer values, used in grammar attribute passing.
- **decaf/lexer/**: Contains the lexer and related classes (generated by SableCC).
- **decaf/node/**: Contains token and AST node classes (generated by SableCC).
- **decaf/analysis/**: Contains analysis interfaces and adapters (generated by SableCC).
- **Sample .decaf files**: Example Decaf programs in both English and German-like syntax for testing the compiler.

## Usage Example

To compile and run the sample German Decaf program:

```sh
java Decaf < german.decaf
```

To use the English version:

```sh
java Decaf < NewComp.decaf
```

## Notes
- The lexer and parser code in `decaf/` is generated by [SableCC](http://www.sablecc.org/).
- The project is designed for educational purposes and demonstrates compiler construction techniques for a simple language.
- For more details on the grammar and language features, see the `.grammar` files in the `sablecc-3.1TD` directory.
